# jest-another-RPG

  ## Description
  This is a console based, fun role-playing game between the player (You) and three enemies (goblin, orc and skeleton). The player will have access to potions that will enhance their agility, health and strength points and fight till whoever wins the game. The winner gets awarded with street credits and bragging rights. The main purpose behind this project was to demonstrate my knowledge on ```OOP (object oriented programming)``` and ```TDD (test driven development)```. Please refer to the ```__tests__``` folder for all the tests I prepared to test out the objects' properties and methods. I chose ```Jest``` as the ```testing framework``` for this project. This application is using ```inquirer``` npm package apart from Jest.
